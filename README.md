Breakfast Cereal is a program designed to better automate the provisioning of bare metal servers. Get started with your day, the lazy way!

2. Project Overview
BreakfastCereal will help data center technicians with bare metal IPMI provisioning using a console connection.

3. Problem Statement
The real problem being addressed is the tedious task of provisioning IPMI on bare metal. There are software solutions available, but that requires a complete install on the server side and an internet connection, which defeats the purpose. IPMITool also requires the use of an internet connection on the server side.

This affects technicians with long days of provisioning and managers who have less staff available to focus on more meaningful tasks.

4. ISBA Subfields
DevOps is implemented through automation of tedious tasks
Networking is implemented through adding new nodes to an internal network
Cybersecurity: Allowing privileged access for only a specific task

6. Solution Overview
* Web App Programming: React, Python, JSON
* APIs: Web Serial API, Ubersmith API
* Hosting: On premise
