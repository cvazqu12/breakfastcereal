# breakfastcereal
Breakfast Cereal is a program designed to better automate the provisioning of bare metal servers. Get started with your day, the lazy way!

2. Project Overview
BreakfastCereal will help data center technicians with bare metal IPMI provisioning using a console connection.

4. Problem Statement
What is the real problem being addressed?
Brief summary of past attempts to solve this problem. Competitors?
How does this problem affect the customer, and how do they currently solve it?
Quantify wasted time, money, or other resources.

The real problem being addressed is the tedious task of provisioning IPMI on bare metal. There are software solutions available, but that requires a complete install and an internet connection, which defeats the purpose. IPMITool also requires the use of an internet connection.

This affects technicians with long days of provisioning and managers who have less staff available to focus on more meaningful tasks.

6. ISBA Subfields
List the 3 ISBA subfields involved.
Provide a short description of how each subfield is implemented.

7. Solution Overview
Describe how you solved the problem in simple terms.
Technical Stack: Bullet-point list of the technologies used:
Programming Languages: (e.g., Python, SQL)
Frameworks: (e.g., Flask, Django)
Data Storage: (e.g., MySQL, S3)
Software/Tools: (e.g., Excel, DBeaver)
APIs: (e.g., OpenAI)
